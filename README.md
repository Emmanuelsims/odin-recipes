This is my first every html web page project ive done. I will be displaying my html skills i have aquired in a couple days. I hope down the life I can look back at this and see how far I became coding. Im very confident that I will do a good job and Ill write a self reflection when im done!!

This is my self reflection... I am fairly comfortable with html and its syntax and their elements and tags. It was fun making it and applying everything I learned and I will look back at this months and years down the line and see how far I came.
